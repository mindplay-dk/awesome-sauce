My awesome, creamy tomato sauce recipe - goes great with beef, chicken, turkey, probably fish too.

I tried to make a sauce that hits all the notes: fat, sugar, salt, acid, umami and subtle heat.

Guests all wanted the recipe, so it's open sauce!

#### Ingredients

Serves 4. Maybe. Depends on how greedy your guests get.

* 2 large onions, finely chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 20 g of butter
* 4 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tsp soy
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* 2 tbsp paprika
* 1 tsp chili
* 1 tsp curry
* 1 1/2 tbsp honey
* 1 tbsp vegetable fond
* 2 tsp salt
* Water
* 1/4 L heavy whipping cream

#### Recipe

1. Cook onion and garlic in butter, in a medium size frying pan, over medium-high heat, for 6-7 minutes.
2. Add tomato paste and a bit of water - keep adding more water and stirring while it evaporates, for 8-10 minutes, until the mixture gels.
3. Stir in all remaining ingredients *except* cream, and cook for another 3-4 of minutes, until it integrates.
3. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.
4, Pour into a container and blend (with a stick blender) until smooth - add a bit more water if it's too sticky to blend.
5. Pour into a sauce pan - gradually stir in the cream while heating the sauce on medium-low heat until barely boiling.

You can make several portions of the sauce base (without cream) and freeze it.

Use a medium (20 cm) frying pan, or a large (30 cm) pan for a double serving. (If the onion is spread too thin, it'll burn rather than gel.)
